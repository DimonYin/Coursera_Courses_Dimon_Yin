1. What is a Convolution?

A technique to filter out unwanted images

A technique to isolate features in images (Correct)

A technique to make images smaller

A technique to make images bigger


2. What is a Pooling?

A technique to isolate features in images

A technique to make images sharper

A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features (Correct)

A technique to combine pictures


3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

They make the image clearer

They isolate features in images (Correct)

They make the image smaller

They make processing of images faster


4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?

28x28

25x25

31x31

26x26 (Correct)


5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?

56x56

13x13 (Correct)

26x26

28x28


6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:

It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN! (Correct)
